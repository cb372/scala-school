# Directory structure

There will be a new directory for each week's session.

The notes will be in README.md.

Any sample code I write while writing the notes will be in `src/main/scala` and will be executable using `sbt run`.

Any hands-on code will be be in `src/test/scala` and executable using `sbt test`.
